# To Do List
A minimal and elegant to-do list web app with a nature-inspired design. Add tasks, mark them as complete with a satisfying green check, or clear everything with one click.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## Features
- Add tasks by typing and pressing Enter  
- Click the green circle to mark tasks as complete   
- Long tasks automatically wrap  
- "Clear Now" button to reset everything  
- Serene, focus-friendly design with custom background

## What I Learned & Practiced
- Perfect vertical centering with `align-items: center` on multi-line flex items
- Preventing layout shift with `flex-shrink: 0`
- Word wrapping long text using `word-break` and `overflow-wrap`
- Made the green task box grow automatically and scroll when full by means of `overflow-y: auto`
- Dynamic DOM manipulation (adding/removing/toggling tasks)

## Future Improvements (Planned)
- Add the number of total, completed, and incomplete tasks to the page 
- Add separate to-do lists for each day of the week (Monday–Sunday)
- Create lists for monthly and yearly tasks too
- Add three buttons to the top of the page, by clicking on which users can navigate between their yearly, monthly, and weekly to-do lists
- LocalStorage persistence (tasks survive page refresh)
- Dark mode toggle 🌙
- Confetti animation when all tasks are completed
